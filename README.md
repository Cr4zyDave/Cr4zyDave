# Welcome to My GitHub. Enjoy your stay :>

You probably ended up here because you're looking for cutting-edge code or **world-class solutions**. Well, let me save you the trouble—this is a place of **broken dreams**, **unoptimized code**, and **questionable decisions**. You’ve been warned. :D

## The Shocking Truth About Me
- **I don't always write clean code**… but when I do, I forget to commit it.
- **I prefer to debug my own mistakes**. Why bother when StackOverflow has the same solution for every issue?
- **This repository is currently under construction**... forever.
- I will **absolutely** ignore your issue request if it’s too complicated. :>

---

### What’s on This Playground?
- **Web Dev Projects**: Mostly half-done tutorials I gave up on. Still, they're here, somewhere.
- **Cybersecurity Tools**: For **educational purposes only**. Not that anyone listens to that.
- **Scripted Solutions**: Because who needs a real solution when you can automate everything? It may or may not work for you, though.

### Skills That I **Totally** Use
- **JavaScript**: A language I can’t quit even though it makes me cry every time.
- **Python**: It's almost like I know what I’m doing... but not really.
- **C++**: Used only when I want to feel like a "serious" programmer, but it's mostly just for flexing.
- **HTML/CSS**: Still amazed I can make a webpage *look* decent. Functionality? Eh, not so much.

---

### Currently **Pretending** to Work On:
- **Perfecting the art of procrastination**.
- **Over-engineering simple things** just to look like I know something.
- **Watching tutorials and thinking "I could totally do that"**.

---

### How You Can Contribute:
- **Fix my bugs**. There are plenty. **Have fun with that**.
- **Fork it**. Who needs to create something new when you can **pretend** to improve something old?
- **Send a PR**. It might be accepted... Or I’ll just ignore it. :>

---

### Let's Be Honest Here:
I’m just another coder on the internet, trying to build useless things and **not** document them. If you find anything that works, well... that’s a **miracle**.

---

### Fun Fact:
My **commit messages** go like this:
- "Fix things" (obviously)
- "Ugh" (on a bad day)
- "No clue what I did, but it works" (on a good day)

Thanks for wasting your time here. The door’s that way if you want to leave, but I’ll just pretend you had a good time. :>
