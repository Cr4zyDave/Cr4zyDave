# Welcome to My GitHub. Don’t Expect Much :>

You’ve found your way here because you’re either bored or you’re hunting for some world-class, clean code. Guess what? You're about to be disappointed. Everything here is a **work in progress**... since forever.

## The Truth:
- I **don’t** write clean code, I write **functional chaos**.
- Debugging? It's just me pretending to know what I’m doing.
- Commit messages? "Fixed things" or "Ugh, why does this work?"

- **I code like it's a life-or-death situation... but mostly it's a nap situation.**
