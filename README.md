# Welcome to the **Domain of Pharaoh, Doing Dope Things**
You’ve found your way here because you’re either bored or you’re hunting for some world-class, clean code. Guess what? You're about to be disappointed. Everything here is a **work in progress**... since forever. **I don't always write clean code**… but when I do, I forget to commit it.
