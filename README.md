You’ve found your way here because you’re either bored or you’re hunting for some world-class, clean code. Guess what? You're about to be disappointed. Everything here is a **work in progress**... since forever. **I don't always write clean code**… but when I do, I forget to commit it.

### My **Non-Impressive** Stats:

### What You Won’t Find Here:
- Working code.
- Documentation that makes sense.
- Anything that remotely looks like a “serious project.”

### How to Contribute:
- **Fork my repos**, I promise I won’t notice.
- **PRs are welcome**, but only if you can tolerate broken things.
