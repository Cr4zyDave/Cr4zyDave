# Welcome to My GitHub. Don‚Äôt Expect Much :>

You‚Äôve found your way here because you‚Äôre either bored or you‚Äôre hunting for some world-class, clean code. Guess what? You're about to be disappointed. Everything here is a **work in progress**... since forever.

## The Truth:
- **I don't always write clean code**‚Ä¶ but when I do, I forget to commit it.
- Debugging? It's just me pretending to know what I‚Äôm doing.
- Commit messages? "Fixed things" or "Ugh, why does this work?"
